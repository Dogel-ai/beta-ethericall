# Ethericall Studio
Studio was created in September of 2018 under the name of KryptoPixels Design Studio.

It's first project was game called "Nation in Blood", which was prepared year before creating the Studio. The project was very ambitious and we made advancements. After not so long, we opened to the people from abroad, which was profitable. Unfortunately after some time, KPDS fell after crisis and project was frozen.

That's when Ethericall was created and we started working on another game - "Monster Cells". It was too ambitious for such little and young studio.

After that we returned to "Nation in Blood". From the beginning we made huge advancements, but because of setback, the Studio was closed.

Many months later we returned as the New Ethericall with new game - The Warsaw Metro Simulator, but we abandoned it because of too small niche. Right now we are working on new, and let's hope, final project called "Tale of 7 Lands".
